    "* The oscillation is created by the bow of the violin, sticking-and-slipping (this is actually a real expression) at a frequency that resonates with the oscillation we see.\n",
    "* When the bow is removed, towards the end of the video, you can see that very quickly, the oscillation becomes like a fundamental oscillation, and nothing else, the kink is gone. That's because in reality, there is damping, and the higher the harmonic is, the stronger the damping acts on it. Indeed, as we saw before, the kink is reproduced by very high modes, and those modes oscillate faster. Assuming (and this is actually a conservative assumption) that the damping force on a mode $n$ can be modeled as something like $-b\\dot y$ again, then it proportional to the frequency: $F_{damping} \\propto \\sum -\\omega_n\\alpha_n\\sin(\\omega_n t)\\sin(k_nx)$. Therefore, the higher a mode is, the faster the damping is. After a short period of time, damping has killed all the modes but the fundamental, which is the last harmonic standing (pun intended).\n",
