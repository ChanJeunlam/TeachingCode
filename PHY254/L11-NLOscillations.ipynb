So, at the crest of the wave, the water is locally deeper, and therefore the crest travels faster than the rest of the wave: it steepens. Note that the KdV equation without the dispersive term is called Burger's equation, and it is *the* equation that models shock waves. This behaviour is why waves on a beach overturn: because the depth keeps decreasing as a wave approaches a short, the non-linearity keeps increasing, and the front of the wave becomes so steep that it overturns.\n",
    "* But then as the wave steepens, the back of the wave becomes longer, and the front of the wave becomes shorter. Dispersion kicks in, the longer back-of-the-wave now travels a bit faster and catches up with the shorter front-of-the-wave, which now travels more slowly.\n",

One of the big explanations are the engineering applications: optical fibers are very dispersive media. Any linear signal sent through them would end up being completely distorted after some time. That's why it is actually non-linear waves that are being sent, in the form of tiny solitons, one after the other.\n",
