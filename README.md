# Teaching samples

This repository contains teaching material samples by Nicolas Grisouard (University of Toronto, Department of Physics).

**On authorship of lecture notes:** lecture notes are not like articles or books. An instructor inherits a sets of notes from a colleague, and re-uses a lot of it, saving time, perpetuating departmental traditions, and allowing students to benefit from tried and tested material. Also, the goal is to explicitely transmit students *old* knowledge, not create new one. As such, I cannot claim sole authorship on these lecture notes. While lecture notes for PHY293 are entirely original, those for PHY407 and PHY254 drew inspriation from lecture notes, written by previous colleagues.

Here however, to ease access to these notes, I decided to make this repository public, while sometimes re-using the exact same words of my previous colleagues. I therefore need to acknoledge my "co-authors":
* Stephen Morris (taught PHY254 in 2013-2015 and 2020),
* Sabine Stanley, now at Johns Hopkins University (taught PHY254 in 2010 and 2012; PHY407 in 2013 and 2014),
* Paul Kushner (taught PHY254 in 2009 and 2011; PHY407 from 2015 to 2017).
